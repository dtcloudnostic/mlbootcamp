            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Welcome to our intensive, 4-hour bootcamp where you'll dive into the world of Python and Machine Learning. Designed with a hands-on approach, our bootcamp will equip you with the tools and techniques currently in demand in the industry. We'll cover everything from Python basics to machine learning algorithms and their applications. By the end of this bootcamp, you'll have the confidence and knowledge to start your own projects or enhance your career opportunities.</p>
                <p>We believe in providing a comprehensive learning experience, and as such, we'll also dive into some special topics in machine learning, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), text classification with Python and Keras, and more. We'll also guide you on how to build a neural network and make predictions using Python AI.</p>
                <p>Lastly, you will also get a chance to apply machine learning to real-world problems. We'll discuss various aspects such as face detection and recognition in Python, speech recognition with Python, sentiment analysis, and building a recommendation engine with collaborative filtering. This is aimed at providing you practical exposure to help you understand the concepts better.</p>
